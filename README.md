## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. My work aims at identifying and characterising star clusters and stellar structures in the Milky Way, by applying efficient data mining and machine learning methods to large datasets. This in turns allows to to map the current structure of the Milky Way in three dimensions, and to track its evolution through time.

Studying star clusters also allows us to take a detailed look at stellar evolution. This HR diagram is constructed from publicly available data, using clusters for which I have established the stellar members and the main parameters:

I am currently the lead developer of the Python package [GaiaUnlimited](https://github.com/gaia-unlimited/gaiaunlimited), a package for querying and constructing selection functions for the Gaia survey developed by the GaiaUnlimited collaboration.

The rest of this page lists some of my professional and hobby projects:


### [Gaia citations through ADS](https://github.com/TristanCantatGaudin/ADS-Gaia-Citations)
Provides daily updates for the number of citations to the Gaia collaboration papers, using the ADS API. The graph is updated every day through GitHub actions. It is also available as an interactive [plotly figure](https://tristancantatgaudin.github.io/ADS-Gaia-Citations/ads-citations-plotly.html).

### [rainbowprint](https://github.com/TristanCantatGaudin/rainbowprint)
A template for a simple Python package. It actually does something: applies colour gradients to string!

### [NBA hexbin](https://github.com/TristanCantatGaudin/nba-hexbin-app)
Streamlit app to display yearly shot volume and efficiency for NBA players. Deployed on Streamlit cloud. Collects data from [BasketBall-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).
