I am an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. My work aims at identifying and characterising star clusters and stellar structures in the Milky Way, by applying efficient data mining and machine learning methods to large datasets. This in turns allows to to map the current structure of the Milky Way in three dimensions, and to track its evolution through time.

I have long been active in spectroscopic surveys, notably writing data processing and analysis software for large batches of observational data for the Gaia-ESO Survey, preparing target catalogues for 4MOST, and in the target selection of WEAVE.

## Cluster mining and Milky-Way mapping

The data collected by the ESA mission Gaia is published as several huge datasets, with the main table having about 2 billion rows and over 100 columns. With efficient methods, we can identify groups of stars with common properties and travelling together through the Galaxy. The projects I have led and participated in use a variety of clustering methods, including `k-means` clustering, `DBSCAN`, `HDBSCAN`, `Gaussian Mixture Models`, and dimensionality reduction techniques such as `t-SNE`, `PCA`, and `UMAP`. Gaia allowed us to discover hundreds of new clusters, some in remote regions of the Milky Way, but many of them in the Solar neighbourhood!

## Estimating the ages and other parameters of star clusters with Neural Networks and Deep Learning

The age of a stellar cluster can be estimated by looking at the distribution of its stars in a colour-magnitude diagram. A complete modelling of this distribution can provide deep insight into the cluster's properties, but can also be extremely time consuming, potentially requiring hours for a single cluster. In order to be able to quickly process thousands of clusters at once, I have [trained a Neural Network](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...640A...1C/abstract) to return cluster ages, and showed that the young clusters trace a fragmented spiral pattern in the Milky Way. In [another paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...635A..45C/abstract) (Castro-Ginard et al. 2020) we used a `Convolutional Neural Network` to automatically classify clusters and asterisms. In [this study](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024AJ....167...12C/abstract) (Cavallo et al. 2024) we make use of optical and near-infrared photometry, and show that our `Multi-Layer Perceptron` is also able to estimate the overall chemical content of cluster stars.

Studying star clusters also allows us to take a detailed look at stellar evolution. This HR diagram is constructed from [publicly available data](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/A+A/640/A1), using clusters for which I have established the stellar members and the main parameters:

### [Gaia citations through ADS](https://github.com/TristanCantatGaudin/ADS-Gaia-Citations)

Provides daily updates for the number of citations to the Gaia collaboration papers, using the ADS API. The graph is updated every day through GitHub actions. It is also available as an interactive <a href="https://tristancantatgaudin.github.io/ADS-Gaia-Citations/ads-citations-plotly.html">plotly figure</a>.
